# TaskMaster - Personal Task Manager

## Description
TaskMaster is a web-based personal task management application. It provides a user-friendly interface for organizing tasks, managing schedules, and boosting productivity.

## Features
- Quick task summary
- Upcoming events overview
- Navigation to detailed task and calendar views
- Background music player

## Structure
The application consists of the following main components:
1. Navigation bar
2. Welcome jumbotron
3. Task summary card
4. Upcoming events card
5. Background music player

## Setup
1. Ensure all HTML files (index.html, tasks.html, calendar.html, profile.html) are in the same directory.
2. Place the MP3 files in a mp3 folder in the same directory as the HTML files.
3. Make sure the styles.css file is present in the same directory.

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Usage
1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Use the navigation bar to move between different sections of the application.
3. View your task summary and upcoming events on the home page.
4. Click on "View Tasks" or "View Calendar" to access more detailed information.
5. Use the audio player at the top of the page to play background music.

## Notes
- The task count and event count are currently placeholder values (0). These would typically be updated dynamically based on user data.
- The background music player is set to loop by default.
- This is a front-end template. Backend functionality would need to be implemented to make the task and event tracking fully functional.

## File Structure
- index.html (main page)
- tasks.html (task details page)
- calendar.html (calendar page)
- profile.html (user profile page)
- styles.css (custom styles)
- mp3 folder - 01.mp3; 02.mp3; 03.mp3; 04.mp3 (background music files)

## Browser Compatibility
This application uses HTML5 features. Ensure you're using a modern, up-to-date web browser for the best experience.

## Create a short overview of your application.
This capstone project is to showcase the usefulness of task manager, which helps organize and remind user's upcoming tasks.  The webpages include a home tab, tasks tab, calendar tab and a profile tab. 

## Highlight the use cases of your application.
This web solution is ideal for those who want to update their upcoming tasks and schedules thru custom format task management online, and scheduled tasks will be deleted automatically based on real time.

## Highlight the technical functionality of the application from a high-level perspective.
Since it's purely a frontend application, in order to communicatie new data input or modification among html pages in the same directory, a temporary cache storage of the broswer need to be ultilized to seamlessly share the update within the directory.  By using java script and some of the functions, it is possible. 

## Discuss what you have learned through the development of the application.
I learned alot of new functions and use case for Bootstraps, css, ES6 syntax, DOM selectors, DRY principle, and so much more.

## Discuss additional features that could be added to the application in the future.
I had difficulty applying video and music applications using java script.  Will try to find out what went wrong in the future by taking small steps.
